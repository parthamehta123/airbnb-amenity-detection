**What's amenity detection?**

Object detection but for common and useful household items someone looking for an Airbnb rental might want to know about. For example, does this home have a fireplace?

Original inspiration was drawn from the article [Amenity Detection and Beyond ‚Äî New Frontiers of Computer Vision at Airbnb](https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/amenity-detection-and-beyond-new-frontiers-of-computer-vision-at-airbnb-144a4441b72e).
