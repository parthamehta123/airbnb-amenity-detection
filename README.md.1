# Replicating Airbnb's Amenity Detection with Detectron2 üëÅ üõè

This repository contains all the code from a project () to replicate Airbnb's amenity detection using [Detectron2](https://github.com/facebookresearch/detectron2).

**What's amenity detection?**

Object detection but for common and useful household items someone looking for an Airbnb rental might want to know about. For example, does this home have a fireplace?

Original inspiration was drawn from the article [Amenity Detection and Beyond ‚Äî New Frontiers of Computer Vision at Airbnb](https://medium.com/airbnb-engineering/amenity-detection-and-beyond-new-frontiers-of-computer-vision-at-airbnb-144a4441b72e).

## Try it for yourself

To see the major pieces of the puzzle (data downloading, preprocessing, modelling), check out the [example Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1gQ8Z2UXYiyQWg7LhfsBuvfO01qLT4eOe).

You can also see a [live and deployed app which uses the model]() (note: this may have been taken down by the time you check it due to costs, an extension would be finding a way to deply the model for little to no costs).
